all 4 generators and their differences
finder methods- orderby,fetch only top 2 records, to fetch only few columns, / 
-- fetch with projections - class and interfaced based projections (when to use which) - advantages and disadvantages of each
pagination and sorting using jpa repository findAll(Pageable p) , findAll(Sort s)
annotations - @modifying
@Query(jpql)
@Query(DML)
@Modifying which is best than fetch and update @Transactional
@Query(native sql)

inheritance mapping strategies - 
single table strategy -- table only for parent
table per class strategy - table only for childs
joined - table for both parent and childs

association relationships examples- 1tomany annotations
@OneToMany(mappedBy="java field name in child entity")
@JoinColumn- 
What is cascading in hibernate - 1)	if u save parent, then childs also will be saved automatically 
all cascade types
eager and lazy loading in 1-many

performance optimization
1) lazy loading

object states in hibernate - transient, persistent, detached, removed
caching in hibernate - session cache vs session factory cache --- EH cache
crudrepo.find() - get it from db save obj into ses, ses fac cache
crudrepo.save() - will just push the data into ses cache/ pers context - it wont save immmediately, it will save only on txn.commit()

@Test
@Transactional
public void m1(){

public void findByName();
public void findByName();
since we already have  transaction , both the finder methods will use a existing txn
1st finder metho. will hit db and stores data in session, 
2nd time also - same finder method, this time it will fetch from session level cache
}


obje state , will crudRepo.save() fires insert query  immediately? what is flush?
