1) in real time, when session is getting opened and when sess is getting closed, we are just using crudRepository.save(), internally is it opening and closing session?????

2) what is difference between jparepo.save(), ses.save(), what happens if we call jparepo.save(), how it is related to ses.save(), see the intervals

3) what happens on ses.close()- means will it closes the connection- then after jparepo.save() will internally ses also will get closed??
